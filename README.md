# Technical-Documents
A Folder containing all of my document based projects (e.g. case studies, thread intelligence reports, incident reports,  etc.)

# What is the purpose of this?
The professional world of computing not only requires expertise in code, but also creating professional documents. In here I showcase my ability to write these documents, feel free to browse around and I am always open to improvement. If there is something I am doing wrong please email me at iqbalsaadman9@gmail.com
